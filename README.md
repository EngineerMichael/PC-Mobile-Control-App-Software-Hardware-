Overview



PC-Mobile-Control-App-Software-Hardware is an open-source project designed to bridge the gap between PC and mobile device control. The app enables users to control their PC or hardware devices from a mobile device through a seamless, easy-to-use interface. This project integrates software running on a PC with mobile hardware, allowing remote control of the PC’s functionality and connected devices.



This application supports a variety of use cases, including media control, device management, hardware monitoring, and customizable actions. The solution works on both Windows and Linux systems, with mobile apps available for Android and iOS. It is an ideal solution for developers and hobbyists looking to create PC-mobile control systems for personal or professional use.

Features

• PC to Mobile Communication: Control a PC from a mobile device over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, allowing full control of system functions.

• Hardware Integration: Interface with connected hardware devices, including sensors, actuators, or IoT devices, enabling remote monitoring and control.

• Customizable Controls: Set up customizable control panels for specific actions like adjusting volume, launching applications, controlling media players, or even monitoring CPU usage.

• Cross-Platform Compatibility: The software works on both Windows and Linux, while the mobile app supports Android and iOS devices.

• Real-Time Data Feedback: Get real-time feedback from the PC, such as hardware stats (e.g., CPU usage, temperature), notifications, or media status updates.

• Easy Setup: The system is easy to configure with minimal setup required. Simply install the server software on your PC and the mobile app on your smartphone.

• Secure Communication: Secure communication between the PC and mobile device through encrypted connections.

• User-Friendly Interface: Both PC and mobile interfaces are designed for ease of use, with intuitive controls and options for configuring the system to suit your needs.



Installation



Prerequisites



To get started, make sure you have the following:

• PC (Server Software):

• Windows or Linux (the app supports both operating systems).

• Wi-Fi or Bluetooth enabled for communication.

• Mobile Device (Client App):

• Android or iOS device for the mobile app.

• Mobile devices must be on the same Wi-Fi network (for Wi-Fi-based communication) or paired via Bluetooth.



Steps to Download and Set Up



1. PC Setup (Server Software)

• Clone the repository to your PC:



git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PC-Mobile-Control-App-Software-Hardware.git

cd PC-Mobile-Control-App-Software-Hardware





• Windows: Download and run the Windows Installer (.exe) or compile the project using Visual Studio.

• Linux: Compile the source code using the following commands:



sudo apt update

sudo apt install build-essential

make





• Once the software is installed, launch the server by running the following command:



./pc-server





• The PC server software should now be running and listening for incoming connections.



2. Mobile App Setup (Client App)

• Android:

• Download the app from the Google Play Store by searching for “PC Mobile Control”.

• Alternatively, you can build the app from source by opening the Android project in Android Studio and running it on your device.

• iOS:

• Download the app from the Apple App Store by searching for “PC Mobile Control”.

• Alternatively, you can build the app from source using Xcode and deploy it to your iPhone.



3. Connecting the PC and Mobile Device

• Ensure both the mobile device and PC are on the same Wi-Fi network (or Bluetooth is enabled for Bluetooth communication).

• Open the mobile app and enter the IP address of your PC server.

• Once connected, the mobile app will display available controls for interacting with the PC or connected hardware devices.



Additional Configuration (Optional)

• Firewall Settings: If you are using a firewall on your PC, ensure that the necessary ports (typically port 8080 for HTTP-based communication) are open for incoming connections.

• Bluetooth Pairing: If you plan to use Bluetooth instead of Wi-Fi, pair your mobile device with the PC using standard Bluetooth pairing procedures.



Usage



1. Control Your PC



Once connected, you can control various aspects of your PC through the mobile app:

• Media Control: Play/pause, skip, and adjust the volume for media applications on your PC (e.g., media players like VLC or Spotify).

• Launch Applications: Open and control installed applications directly from your mobile device.

• System Monitoring: View real-time data about your system, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and more.



2. Interact with Hardware Devices

• IoT Devices: If you have connected IoT devices or sensors, you can control or monitor them via the mobile app. This could include controlling lights, motors, or other connected devices.



3. Customize the Controls



You can customize the layout of your controls, creating shortcuts for specific actions, such as:

• Adding quick-access buttons to launch frequently used apps.

• Creating custom sliders for volume or brightness adjustment.

• Setting up automated actions (e.g., automatically start a media player upon launch).



4. Security and Authentication



For added security, the PC software includes the ability to set up a password or use token-based authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can control the system.
